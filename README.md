Proposal: Human Resources Data challenge
Sylvester Brown

Introduction:
I have a business management degree background through an MBA. I want to use this project to
showcase my skills and understanding of data science in the Business world. I have chosen this
human resource dataset found on Kaggle for my first Data Science Practicum. This interest in
HR was fueled by recent desires to interview for positions in the field. A successful completion
of this project may be part of the portfolio that sets me apart from other candidates.

Purpose of project:
Showcase skills in data manipulation and engineering, exploratory data analysis, visualizations
and Machine leaning.

The problems to solve are:
1. what main characteristics contribute to the reason of why employees are leaving?
2. Which learning model appears to be better for predicting which employees will leave.

Finding a Dataset:
There appears to be no real-world dataset from a company. So far, my research has led me to
believe that all dataset in this field have been somewhat engineered for use in a data science
setting or project. On Kaggle.com I discovered the dataset “Human Resource.” The dataset
belongs to William Walter. Data can be found at “https://www.kaggle.com/colara/humanresource”

Description:
The Human Resources Dataset is a dataset hosted on Kaggle primarily for learning data
visualization and machine leaning tools. The dataset contains 10 characteristics for 14,999
employees. The categories are:
. satisfaction_level . last_evaluation . number_project . average_montly_hours .
time_spend_company . Work_accident . left (whether the employee has left) .
promotion_last_5years . sales . salary

Analysis:
To account for level of difficulty and creativity and showcase basic data science skills. I will be
doing a comparative analysis by doing the project in both R and python environments. I will be
doing research into various EDA, visualizations and Machine leaning skills on both platforms.
For the machine learning algorithms I will explore but not limit to KNN, Random Forest,
Logistic Regression, and K-Means.

Timeline:
Week 2 – Research and Data Preprocessing
Week 3 – Explore Data in Multiple Formats (EDA part 1)
. Data munging and engineering
Week 4 - Explore Data in Multiple Formats (EDA part 2)
. visualization
Week 5 – machine learning (part 1)
Week 6 – Machine learning (part 2)
Week 7 – GitHub, PowerPoint presentation
Week 8 – Finalize deliverables and Submit Results
